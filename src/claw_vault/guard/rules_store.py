"""Persistence and data models for custom guard rules.

Rules are stored in a YAML file under the ClawVault config directory:
`~/.ClawVault/rules.yaml`.

The format is intentionally simple and human-friendly, for example:

```yaml
- id: block-injections
  name: Block all prompt injections
  enabled: true
  action: block
  when:
    has_injections: true

- id: sanitize-sensitive
  name: Auto-sanitize sensitive data above risk 5
  enabled: true
  action: sanitize
  when:
    has_sensitive: true
    min_risk_score: 5.0
```
